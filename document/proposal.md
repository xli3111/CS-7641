# CS 7641 Final Project Proposal

---

## 1. Introduction / Background
Our project explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict **[your task]** using **[dataset name]**.  
We reviewed literature including:  
- [Paper A]  
- [Paper B]  
Dataset contains [samples, features, etc.].  
**ðŸ“Ž Dataset link**: [link]

---

## 2. Problem Definition
We aim to solve the problem of **[classification/regression/clustering]**.  
Motivated by [real-world relevance].

---

## 3. Methods

### Data Preprocessing
- Standardization
- Imputation
- PCA
- Feature Engineering

### ML Algorithms
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- K-Means Clustering  

**ðŸ“š Tools**: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`
